# Homework 2: Lighting & Particle System
### 1. Add at least 4 lights to your scene
Point Light
Directional Light
Spotlight
Area Light
Emissive Material (Cube)

---

### 2. Create a lighting transition

UI button to switch between lights dimmed/on/off

---

#### 3. Add a particle system

2D Texture emitter - hearts coming from head of rat

---

#### 4. "Polished" Look

### Cohesive scene
My scene is inspired by my real bedroom, or ‘Julie’s Abode.’ It’s not an exact replica (I wish I had an arcade cabinet in there)
but this scene of my room is about 80% accurate. I included objects that resembled ones in my room. I have my bed and desk in the
corners of my room across from one another, such as in the scene. I also have a dresser and a laundry basket in the right corner
of the room, as well as an abundance of plants everywhere and a stool in front of my bed. The main character in my scene is
a pink origami rat because my nickname on Discord has been “a rat” since… forever… and I thought it was so cute!

### Interesting lighting
Gave the lamp in the corner of my room a point light so that it would glow. Had a directional light which was the sun. Had a spotlight
on the rat because it's the star of the show. Had an emissive cube where the screen of the arcade cabinet was to make it look more
realistic. Added an area light glow from the screen of the arcade cabinet to help it look more alive as well.


### Good use of materials/textures
I used a heart material for the 2D particle system so it would be like the rat is thinking that it loves how it looks (since it is
looking in the mirror) which I thought was wholesome. Also used a pink emissive material for the screen of the arcade cabinet so it
would match the color of the cabinet. The materials used for the objects in the game also resemble the colors of the objects in my
room to match.
